# Planning-PDDL

In this repository, I encoded a planning domain for a supposed tavern using PDDL with a standardized syntax. 

### Testing
In order to test the functionality of the planner please view http://editor.planning.domains/# in the browser and use the code as input there.

### The editor will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any errors in the console (in the output field).
